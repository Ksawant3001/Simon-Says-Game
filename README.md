# Simon-Says-Game

•	Developed an interactive Simon Says memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to memorize and repeat color sequences.
•	Implemented random sequence generation to create a new sequence for each round, with user input validation to check responses for accuracy.
•	Created a dynamic user interface with CSS animations to provide visual feedback on user actions (e.g., flashing colors, success/failure indicators).
•	Utilized JavaScript event listeners to capture and respond to user clicks, ensuring real-time game interactions and sequence matching and incorporated a score tracking system to display progress.
•	Tested the game across multiple browsers to ensure consistent performance and smooth animations.

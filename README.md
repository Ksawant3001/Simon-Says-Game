# Simon-Says-Game

The Simon Says game is a memory-based challenge where players must repeat a growing sequence of colors built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each round, the game displays a sequence of button flashes in four colors (red, blue, yellow, green). Players then click the buttons in the same order. If they succeed, they advance to the next level, with the sequence lengthening each time, testing their memory further.

Key Elements:

Start Button: Begins the game.
Color Buttons: Flash in sequence for the player to repeat.
Score Display: Tracks how many rounds the player has completed.
Objective: Replicate the color sequence as it grows in length. The game ends when the player makes a mistake, challenging them to remember increasingly complex patterns.

This simple game is engaging due to its increasing difficulty, which encourages players to push their memory limits.
